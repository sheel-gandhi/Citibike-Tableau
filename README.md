## Summary

* **Male riders are highest in subscribers category and they have the highest tripduration**
* **Bike Repairs for one-third of the Citibikes has to be done during non-peak hours around 1:00-5:00 am.**
* **Target market should be males needing transportation to work and weekend activities and push for subscribing to the services.**

## Recommendations:
* **A chart showing a relationship between subscribers as weekday users with regular usage and customers as weekend users with recreational purpose can be shown.** 
* **A chart showing rides starting and ending location by gender can be created seperately which will emphasize on usage per gender per location.**
